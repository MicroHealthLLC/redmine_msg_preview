## Redmine Outlook .MSG Preview

This plugin to [Redmine](http://redmine.org) parses Microsoft Outlook MSG
file attachments within an issues attachment list. These attachments can then
be opened and viewed directly within Redmine without needing an instance of
Outlook installed on your local machine.
